Paphos trends again. Not because of resorts or weddings, but because locals are talking about silence. Fewer flights, fewer festivals, fewer jobs. The tourist town is facing a slow season and nobody knows what to replace it with.  

On social media, users post nostalgic photos tagged #OldPaphos. Bars close earlier, digital nomads move to Limassol, and yet small cafés on side streets stay full.  

The town’s charm is not gone, just quieter. Maybe the next wave will not come from tourists but from those who never left.
