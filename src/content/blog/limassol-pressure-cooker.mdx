Every day, a new tower. Every week, another complaint about rent. Limassol has become both a symbol of growth and of burnout. Influencers show rooftop views while residents count expenses.  

The city’s business district glows with fintech promises, yet behind the cafés and co-working spaces, workers share two-bedroom flats. The contrast is sharp.  

In the data, Limassol trends second only to weather. People scroll through luxury and heat alerts in the same feed. Progress looks good until it becomes unlivable.
