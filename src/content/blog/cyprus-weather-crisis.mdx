The word “weather” trended across Cyprus all week, and not for good reasons. Temperatures hit records again while humidity wrapped the coast like plastic. Hashtags like #CyprusHeat and #NoRainSinceJune climbed into local charts.
Nicosia saw brief storms that turned to dust clouds in hours. Farmers called it the worst autumn start in a decade. Tourists in Paphos uploaded pool selfies while locals queued for bottled water.  

Meteorologists warned that climate patterns are shifting faster than the island’s infrastructure can adapt. The forecast stopped being news. It became a reminder.
